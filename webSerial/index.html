  <h1>WebSerial Example</h1>
  <section id="explanation">
    <p>
      This page sends out a serial port using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API">WebSerial API</a>. It should work on Chrome and Edge browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To open a port, Click the "open port" button and pick a port. To close that port, click the button again.
      You can open and close the port multiple times, but you can only open one port at a time.
      This page sends and receives ascii-encoded strings. There's also a commented-out option showing how to
      parse a string as a JSON ojbect.
    </p>
    <p>As of 15 May 2022, the webserial script that this sketch is using auto-detects new serial ports and opens them. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/tigoe/html-for-conndev/tree/main/webSerial/ArduinoSendReceive">Arduino sketch that works with it.</a></p>

    <p>If you'd like to see the source code, it's <a
        href="https://github.com/tigoe/html-for-conndev/tree/main/webSerial">here on gitHub</a>. There's an Arduino
      sketch in that directory that will work with this page. It will echo back whatever you send it, and once a second,
      it will send you the number of seconds since it started as a JSON string.</p>
    <p>
      Here is a <a href="https://web.dev/serial/">helpful introduction to WebSerial</a>. Most of this script was based on that tutorial.
    </p>
